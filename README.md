# Todo List

This application was made using React.js. Todo List is a simple note taking application with a calendar to organize notes more efficiently. You can click on each day of the calendar and add a corresponding note to it which will then be saved on a local sqlite database. You can also put notes in advance by toggling the next/previous button on the calendar and double clicking the specified date! A form would pop up to which then you can add a description of the note.

# How To Run

You must have a npm installed on your system! Go to the directory and run **npm install**. Once done you can run **npm start** and it should be serving on your **localhost:3000**. Enjoy!

# Persistent Storage

This app uses IndexedDB which is built-in on most browsers.
